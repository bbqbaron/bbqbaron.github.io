Welcome. How do I static-site? Let's find out.

I'm a Magic dork. To that end, here is a chart of the distribution of colors with which the 20 highest color-weight card-name words are associated. "Color weight" (by which the x-axis is sorted) is the count of all colored mana symbols in costs of cards with that word in the name.

NB My choice of metrics means that more expensive cards increase affinity and color weight further. This is a count of how much color "oomph" is associated with each weight, not number of printed cards! If, eg, MTG somehow printed 10 different 1-cost "Dragon [Whatever]" cards and 1 10-cost "Darby Flanagan, Chef Overlord" costing RRGGBBUUWW, "Darby" and "Dragon" would have a color weight of 10.

"Words" are split quite naively, ie essentially whitespace (hence things like "//", which I still find illuminating!)

Musings:

* "of", "the", and "to" are disproportionately W. Perhaps it reflects a tendency toward officious, lawful-sounding names? People with titles?
* points to Goblins for their unswerving loyalty over the years, particularly given how cheap they are. Maybe it's just easy to call something "Goblin Foobar" and get on with it
* I have a theory that "Elf" does not appear here because the English morphology of "Elf" is more complex than that of "Goblin". Eg "Elven", "Elvish", whereas "Goblin" is both noun and adjective.

PS:

I am a blogging novice. I've literally hand-embedded an HTML export of a Vega chart here. How would you do it? Just a PNG?
